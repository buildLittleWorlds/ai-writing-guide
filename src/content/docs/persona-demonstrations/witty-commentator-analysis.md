## Analysis: Dr. Rappaccini: The Martha Stewart of Poison Gardens

Ah, Dr. Rappaccini—that charming gentleman who approaches gardening with all the warm fuzzy feelings of a Bond villain designing a doomsday device. One must admire his dedication to home improvement, creating what amounts to an Italian Renaissance version of a biohazard containment facility, complete with decorative fountains and lethal foliage. The text tells us he tends his garden with:

> *"A pair of thick gloves" and "a kind of mask over his mouth and nostrils,"*

which really makes one wonder about his Yelp reviews as a landscape designer. (Though I suppose *"Would die to have this garden!"* takes on a rather literal meaning here.)

Consider his innovative approach to helicopter parenting, wherein he creates an entire ecosystem of death just to keep his daughter from dating unsuitable boys. As we learn:

> *"Evidently her experience of life had been confined within the limits of that garden"*—

a brilliant solution to the age-old problem of overprotective fathers everywhere. Why bother with curfews and stern talks when you can simply engineer an environment so toxic that any potential suitor requires full hazmat gear? It's like those fathers who clean their shotguns when their daughter's date arrives, except Rappaccini has upgraded to biological warfare.

But the true genius of our botanical mad scientist reveals itself in his matchmaking skills. Having successfully created a daughter who can't touch normal humans without killing them (talk about social distancing!), he then contaminates poor Giovanni so they can be together. As he proudly declares:

> *"Thou art no longer lonely in the world"*—

because nothing says *"I love you"* quite like forcing someone to become as poisonous as your science experiment of a daughter. It's rather like arranging a marriage by first giving both parties the same incurable disease; unconventional perhaps, but certainly ensures they have something in common. One might call it the ultimate gated community: admission requires complete biological transformation, and the HOA fees are absolutely deadly.
