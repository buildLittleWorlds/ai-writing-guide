## Analysis: The Garden as Prison: Rappaccini's Monstrous Management

Must we not recognize the profound evil in Rappaccini's manipulation of his garden space, transforming what should be a sanctuary of natural beauty into a carefully controlled prison of poison? When Hawthorne shows us this man:

> *"Walking among malignant influences, such as savage beasts, or deadly snakes, or evil spirits,"*

we witness not merely scientific caution but moral corruption. His thick gloves and protective mask reveal more than fear of contamination—they expose his fundamental separation from the life he claims to nurture. How can we not condemn a man who approaches his own creation with such revulsion, who has perverted the innocent act of gardening into an exercise in calculated destruction?

Consider, then, the devastating consequences of his environmental management on his own daughter, trapped within the deadly paradise he has engineered. When Beatrice confesses:

> *"An awful doom, the effect of my father's fatal love of science, which estranged me from all society of my kind,"*

we must hear this as more than personal tragedy—it is an accusation against a father who has sacrificed his child's humanity on the altar of scientific ambition. Is this not the ultimate betrayal, to confine one's own flesh and blood within walls of poisonous blooms, to make her guardian of a toxic eden from which she can never escape? The garden becomes not just a physical space but a psychological torture chamber where isolation breeds despair.

Yet even this is not enough for Rappaccini's monstrous ambition. When he proclaims to his daughter:

> *"Thou art no longer lonely in the world,"*

having engineered Giovanni's contamination, we witness the culmination of his environmental tyranny. This is not the resolution of loneliness but its weaponization—he has created a space where human connection can exist only through shared poison, where love becomes lethal, where embrace means death. Must we not cry out against this perversion of natural spaces, this transformation of a garden—that most ancient symbol of life and renewal—into an instrument of control and corruption? Rappaccini stands revealed not as a scientist but as a destroyer, his garden not a place of growth but a carefully managed hell where humanity itself is the final experiment.
