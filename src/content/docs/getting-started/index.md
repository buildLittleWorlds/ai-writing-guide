description: Learn how to use this guide for AI-assisted writing with stylistic control
---

This guide introduces a structured approach to maintaining control over writing style when collaborating with AI writing tools. The methodology presented is based on the "Dual Curation Method" which involves two complementary practices:

## The Dual Curation Method

### 1. Author-Side Curation

This involves collecting examples of specific sentence structures, diction choices, tonal effects, and rhetorical moves from writers you admire. These examples form a "stylistic library" that helps you define distinct authorial personasâ€”which you can then use to guide AI tools.

### 2. Research-Side Curation

This involves gathering facts, examples, quotations, anecdotes, and specialized information that will inform the content of your writing. Different personas naturally gravitate toward different types of evidence and examples.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is organized into several key sections:

1. **Persona Toolkit**: A detailed vocabulary and coding system for dissecting specific linguistic choices writers make at the sentence level.

2. **Prose Personas**: Ten foundational authorial voices constructed from characteristic combinations of linguistic elements.

3. **Research Insights**: Findings from empirical studies on effectively controlling LLM output through in-context examples.

4. **Author Resources**: A curated list of writers and works exemplifying different stylistic approaches.

5. **Examples**: Practical demonstrations of these concepts in action.

## Suggested Learning Path

If you're new to these concepts, we recommend:

1. Start by exploring the [Persona Toolkit](/persona-toolkit/) to understand the basic building blocks of style
2. Review the [Prose Personas](/personas/) to see how these elements combine into recognizable voices
3. Study the [Examples](/examples/) to see these concepts applied in real writing
4. Explore the [Research](/research/) to understand the theory behind controlling AI output
5. Use the [Author Resources](/author-resources/) to find inspiration for your own stylistic curation

Remember, the goal isn't to rigidly adhere to a single persona but to develop a nuanced understanding of stylistic techniques that allows you to guide AI tools in supporting your unique voice.
