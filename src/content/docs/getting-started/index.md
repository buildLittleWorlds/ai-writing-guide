description: Learn how to use this guide for AI-assisted writing with stylistic control
---

This guide introduces a structured approach to maintaining control over writing style when collaborating with AI writing tools. The methodology presented is based on the "Dual Curation Method" which involves two complementary practices:

## The Dual Curation Method

### 1. Author-Side Curation

This involves collecting examples of specific sentence structures, diction choices, tonal effects, and rhetorical moves from writers you admire. These examples form a "stylistic library" that helps you define distinct authorial personasâ€”which you can then use to guide AI tools.

### 2. Research-Side Curation

This involves gathering facts, examples, quotations, anecdotes, and specialized information that will inform the content of your writing. Different personas naturally gravitate toward different types of evidence and examples.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is organized into several key sections:

1. **Persona Toolkit**: A detailed vocabulary and coding system for dissecting specific linguistic choices writers make at the sentence level.

2. **Prose Personas**: Ten foundational authorial voices constructed from characteristic combinations of linguistic elements.

3. **Research Insights**: Findings from empirical studies on effectively controlling LLM output through in-context examples.

4. **Resources**: Practical tools and examples for applying these concepts in AI-assisted writing, including:
   - **Persona Prompts**: Ready-to-use instructions for guiding AI toward specific voices
   - **Essay Writing with Personas**: A sequential dialogue demonstrating how different personas can work together
   - **Literary Analysis with Personas**: Parallel analyses showing how each persona approaches the same subject

## Suggested Learning Path

If you're new to these concepts, we recommend:

1. Start by exploring the [Persona Toolkit](/persona-toolkit/) to understand the basic building blocks of style
2. Review the [Prose Personas](/personas/) to see how these elements combine into recognizable voices
3. Explore the [Research](/research/) to understand the theory behind controlling AI output
4. Use the [Resources](/resources/) section to see practical applications and ready-to-use tools:
   - Utilize the [Persona Prompts](/resources/persona-prompts/) to guide AI tools toward your desired style
   - Examine the [Essay Writing sequence](/resources/essay-writing/) to learn how different personas can work together
   - Study the [Literary Analysis examples](/resources/literary-analysis/) to see how each persona approaches identical content

Remember, the goal isn't to rigidly adhere to a single persona but to develop a nuanced understanding of stylistic techniques that allows you to guide AI tools in supporting your unique voice.
