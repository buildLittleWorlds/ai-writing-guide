## Example Passage

> How much longer will we avert our eyes from this injustice? Every day that we delay, more families lose their homes, more children go hungry, more communities crumble. These are not distant tragedies happening to strangersâ€”they are happening here, now, to our neighbors, to people whose stories differ from our own only by the cruel whims of circumstance. We cannot claim ignorance; we cannot plead helplessness. The tools for change are within our grasp if only we have the courage to use them.
