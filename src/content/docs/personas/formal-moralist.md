## Example Passage

> Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that makes what we read ours. A man of learning is always ready to think upon any subject, having a supply of principles to proceed upon. The most valuable learning is that which teaches us how to manage our minds. Time spent in reflection is never wasted; hurry only makes knowledge superficial. The true aim of education is not merely to transmit information, but to form character and cultivate wisdom. The wise are those who see connections between knowledge and action.
