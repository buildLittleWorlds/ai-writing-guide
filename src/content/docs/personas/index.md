description: Ten foundational authorial voices for AI-assisted writing
---

This section introduces ten recurring prose personas found in creative nonfiction. Each persona represents a distinctive authorial voice created through specific combinations of the linguistic elements covered in the [Persona Toolkit](/persona-toolkit/).

## What Are Prose Personas?

Prose personas are recognizable authorial voices characterized by consistent patterns of sentence structure, diction, tone, figurative language, and point of view. These patterns create a distinctive "feel" to the writing that readers can recognize even across different topics or contexts.

Understanding these personas provides:

1. **A framework for analysis**: Identifying what makes different writers' styles distinctive
2. **Versatile templates**: Adaptable patterns for different writing situations
3. **Guidance for AI collaboration**: Clear examples to direct AI tools toward specific stylistic goals

## The Ten Prose Personas

Each of the following personas combines elements from the Persona Toolkit in characteristic ways:

1. [**The Precisionist Observer/Reporter**](/personas/precisionist-observer/): Stands slightly apart, observing closely and reporting with clarity, detail, and often emotional control.

2. [**The Intimate Confidante**](/personas/intimate-confidante/): Speaks directly and personally, sharing vulnerabilities, memories, feelings, and quirky thoughts.

3. [**The Authoritative Expert/Scholar**](/personas/authoritative-expert/): Speaks from a position of deep knowledge, aiming to explain complex subjects, analyze evidence, or build a rigorous argument.

4. [**The Passionate Advocate/Witness**](/personas/passionate-advocate/): Speaks with urgency and moral conviction, aiming to persuade, challenge injustice, bear witness to suffering, or call the reader to action.

5. [**The Contemplative/Lyrical Inquirer**](/personas/contemplative-inquirer/): Explores ideas, nature, memory, or the mysteries of existence with a thoughtful, often poetic sensibility.

6. [**The Engaging Narrator/Raconteur**](/personas/engaging-narrator/): Primarily focused on telling a story, often anecdotal, biographical, or historical.

7. [**The Witty/Ironic Commentator**](/personas/witty-commentator/): Observes the world (or the self) with humor, skepticism, and often a sharp satirical edge.

8. [**The Formal Moralist/Aphorist**](/personas/formal-moralist/): Speaks with authority and often a degree of impersonality, delivering wisdom, precepts, or judgments in concise, memorable statements.

9. [**The Philosophical Investigator**](/personas/philosophical-investigator/): Delves into abstract questions of existence, knowledge, ethics, consciousness, meaning, logic, or the nature of reality itself.

10. [**The Systems Explainer / Tech Chronicler**](/personas/systems-explainer/): Dedicated to making complex systems, processes, histories, or concepts understandable.

## Creating Hybrid Personas

While these ten personas provide useful archetypes, great writing often blends elements from multiple personas. For example:

- Joan Didion often combines the Precisionist Observer (#1) with elements of the Intimate Confidante (#2) and occasionally the Contemplative Inquirer (#5).
- Malcolm Gladwell merges the Systems Explainer (#10) with the Engaging Narrator (#6).
- James Baldwin's work frequently blends the Intimate Confidante (#2) with the Passionate Advocate (#4) and the Philosophical Investigator (#9).

As you explore these personas, consider how you might combine their elements to create your own unique voice or to guide AI tools in generating content with the specific stylistic features you desire.
