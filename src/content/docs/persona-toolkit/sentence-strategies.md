title: Sentence Strategy Patterns
description: Techniques for shaping thought, pace, and emphasis in sentences
---

Sentence strategy patterns shape thought, pace, and emphasis in writing. They define the structure and flow of ideas and can dramatically affect how readers process information.

These patterns are divided into two main categories:

- **Paratactic Patterns**: Using coordination and juxtaposition
- **Hypotactic Patterns**: Using subordination

## Paratactic Patterns (Coordination & Juxtaposition)

These primarily link clauses equally or place them side-by-side, creating effects of immediacy, clarity, listing, breathlessness, or stark contrast.

### S1 - Declarative Brevity

Short, direct, declarative sentences.

**Effect**: Impact, clarity, factual assertion, starkness, quick pace.

**Example**: "She left. He stayed. The room grew cold."

### S2 - Cumulative Coordination

Building sentences by adding coordinate clauses or phrases ("and," "but," "or," "so").

**Effect**: Forward momentum, accumulating detail, sense of flow or ongoing action/thought.

**Example**: "The car swerved and the brakes screamed and the pedestrians scattered and somehow nobody was hurt."

### S3 - Parallelism & Listing

Using parallel grammatical structures for phrases/clauses, often creating lists or series.

**Effect**: Rhythm, emphasis, inventory, balance, rhetorical force, clarity of comparison/contrast.

**Example**: "She came to work, to learn, to challenge herself, to make a difference."

### S4 - Juxtaposition

Placing contrasting ideas, images, or clauses side-by-side without explicit connectors (or using minimal ones like semicolons).

**Effect**: Forces reader inference, creates irony, highlights contrast or tension, generates surprise.

**Example**: "The mansion loomed, pristine white; the slums crouched in its shadow."

### S5 - Associative Connection (Stream-of-Consciousness markers)

Loosely connected clauses often linked by dashes, ellipses, or minimal conjunctions, mimicking thought processes.

**Effect**: Immediacy, interiority, informality, sometimes fragmentation or anxiety.

**Example**: "I wondered about calling her—maybe tomorrow—or perhaps just a text—though that seems impersonal—but she might prefer…"

### S6 - Dialogic Rhythm

Short, clipped sentences or fragments mimicking speech turns in dialogue or rapid exchange.

**Effect**: Creates pace, tension, realism in dialogue-heavy passages or sections mimicking conversation.

**Example**: "You went there? Alone? After midnight? What were you thinking? Nothing good happens after midnight."

### S7 - Cinematic Cutting

Abrupt shifts between sentences representing different scenes, images, or points in time, like film cuts.

**Effect**: Montage effect, speed, dynamism, disorientation, highlighting connections through sequence.

**Example**: "The knife gleamed in the kitchen light. The empty street echoed with footsteps. A phone rang unanswered in an empty apartment."

## Hypotactic Patterns (Subordination)

These embed clauses within others, creating hierarchies of meaning and effects of complexity, nuance, argument, reflection, or qualification.

### S8 - Nested Subordination

Clauses embedded within clauses.

**Effect**: Dense, layered meaning, intellectual complexity, intricate thought, potential for ponderousness.

**Example**: "The theory, which was developed by researchers who had spent decades studying cognitive processes that underlie decision-making, suggests that the assumptions, on which we have built our understanding of human rationality, require radical revision."

### S9 - Parenthetical Insertion

Inserting qualifying phrases, asides, or commentary using parentheses, dashes, or commas.

**Effect**: Adds texture, voice intrusion, qualification, humor, shifts in tone, mimics spoken asides.

**Example**: "The president's speech (which no one actually believed) outlined an ambitious agenda for reform."

### S10 - Forward-Branching (Loose Sentence)

Main clause comes first, followed by modifying subordinate clauses or phrases.

**Effect**: Elaboration, description, qualification, natural conversational rhythm, clarity.

**Example**: "She walked through the garden, admiring the roses, inhaling their scent, remembering summers from her childhood."

### S11 - Backward-Branching

Subordinate clauses or phrases precede the main clause.

**Effect**: Builds context, tension, suspense; leads the reader toward the main point.

**Example**: "Despite the rain pouring down and the wind howling through the trees and the thunder cracking overhead, she continued her journey."

### S12 - Periodic Sentence Structure

Main clause/meaning is delayed until the very end, often after multiple subordinate clauses.

**Effect**: Creates suspense, emphasis on the final point, formality, rhetorical weight.

**Example**: "When the evidence has been examined, when the witnesses have testified, when all arguments have been heard and all facts considered, then and only then will justice be served."

### S13 - Qualification & Hedging

Using phrases that limit or qualify claims ("to the extent that," "insofar as," "it seems," "perhaps," "often").

**Effect**: Precision, nuance, academic caution, sometimes tentativeness or evasiveness.

**Example**: "This approach might, under certain conditions and with appropriate safeguards, offer a partial solution to what appears to be an increasingly intractable problem."

### S14 - Logical Connectives

Explicitly showing logical relationships using conjunctions/adverbs like "because," "although," "since," "therefore," "consequently," "however."

**Effect**: Builds clear arguments, structures reasoning, emphasizes logical flow.

**Example**: "Although initial results seemed promising, subsequent studies revealed complications; therefore, researchers have adopted a more cautious approach."
