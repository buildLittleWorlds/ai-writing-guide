description: A detailed vocabulary for dissecting linguistic choices in writing
---

The Persona Toolkit provides a detailed vocabulary and coding system for analyzing and replicating specific linguistic choices writers make at the sentence level. This systematic approach allows you to:

1. **Identify patterns** in writing styles you admire
2. **Articulate precisely** what makes a particular voice distinctive
3. **Curate examples** of specific techniques for your stylistic library
4. **Direct AI tools** to generate text with these specific characteristics

The toolkit breaks down writing style into five major categories, each with its own classification system:

## Sentence Strategy Patterns (S#)

These shape thought, pace, and emphasis. They include paratactic patterns (coordination and juxtaposition) and hypotactic patterns (subordination).

## Diction, Tone, & Figurative Language (D#, T#, F#)

These shape attitude, relationship, and texture. They include word choices, implied feelings toward subjects, and non-literal language.

## Voice & Point of View Markers (V#)

These shape perspective and authority. They include point of view, modal verbs, intensifiers, and other markers that establish the speaker's relationship to the content.

## Using the Toolkit

When analyzing texts, you can use these codes (like S1, D2a, T3) to identify specific techniques. For example, you might note that a passage uses:

- S1 (Declarative Brevity) for impact and clarity
- D2b (Concrete/Sensory language) for vividness
- T7 (Urgent/Passionate tone) for emotional engagement
- V1a (First-Person voice) for intimacy

This systematic approach allows for precise analysis and replication of stylistic elements. When working with AI tools, providing examples tagged with these codes helps guide the model toward a specific stylistic direction.

The toolkit forms the foundation for understanding how different combinations of these elements create the distinct "Prose Personas" covered in the next section.
