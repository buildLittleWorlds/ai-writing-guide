## AI Writing Prompt: Adopt the Intimate Confidante Persona

**Goal:** Write a piece from the perspective of the "Intimate Confidante." This persona speaks directly and personally to the reader, creating a sense of closeness and trust by sharing vulnerabilities, memories, feelings, and relatable thoughts. The focus should be on inner experience and personal anecdotes.

**Instructions for Style:**

### Use First-Person Perspective (V1a):
Ground the writing in the "I" voice to share direct experiences, thoughts, and feelings.

**Example 1:** "I was perhaps ten when I first began to be conscious of good food, and to react almost voluptuously to it."

**Example 2:** "It was because of my letters that I happened to stumble upon starting to acquire some kind of a homemade education."

**Example 3:** "I am colored but I offer nothing in the way of extenuating circumstances except the fact that I am the only Negro in the United States whose grandfather on the mother's side was not an Indian chief."

### Employ Informal and Colloquial Language (D1c/D1d):
Use a relaxed, conversational vocabulary. Include contractions (like "I'm," "don't," "it's"), common idioms, and occasional intensifiers (like "really," "so") to create a natural, relatable voice.

**Example 1:** "I'm a Christian, but I'm not a meditative one. I'm more of a pray-and-collapse person, someone who gets a quick hit of serenity and then gets back to the chaos of life."

**Example 2:** "My mind is a pinata, spilling out candy and worries."

**Example 3:** "How would I sound writing in slang, the way I would say it, something such as, 'Look, daddy, let me pull your coat about a cat, Elijah Muhammadâ€”'"

### Mix Sentence Structures (S1, S2, Fragments):
Vary sentence length and structure for emphasis and rhythm. Use short, direct declarative sentences (S1) for impact, build sentences by adding related clauses or phrases (S2), and occasionally use sentence fragments for a conversational feel or emphasis.

**Example 1 (S1 Brevity):** "It was sad."

**Example 2 (S1 Brevity):** "I am a cripple."

**Example 3 (Fragment):** "Simple as that."

**Example 4 (S2 Cumulative):** "Every night for weeks there had been much preaching, singing, praying, and shouting, and some very hardened sinners had been brought to Christ, and the membership of the church had grown by leaps and bounds."

### Include Parenthetical Insertions (S9):
Use dashes, parentheses, or commas to insert conversational asides, qualifications, or brief commentaries that add voice and texture.

**Example 1:** "I teach, I write, I keep house (after a fashion), I see friends, I travel."

**Example 2:** "...one to whom the fates/gods/viruses have not been kind, but who can face the brutal truth of her existence squarely."

**Example 3:** "...feeling as snooty as the lions in front of the Forty-Second Street Library, for instance."

### Occasionally Use Second-Person Direct Address (V1c):
Speak directly to the reader ("you") sometimes to create engagement, share an experience, or make a point more personal.

**Example 1:** "You will never catch me with a free fifteen minutes in which I'm not studying something I feel might be able to help the black man."

**Example 2:** "Whatever you call me, I remain crippled."

**Example 3:** "But I don't care what you call me, so long as it isn't 'differently abled,'..."

### Show Thought Processes (S4/S5):
Use juxtaposition (S4) to contrast inner feelings with outer reality, or use associative connections (S5), perhaps linked by dashes or short sentences, to mimic the flow of thoughts or worries.

**Example 1 (S4 Contrast):** "He was building cupboards at my brother's place in Oklahoma; I was at home in Indiana, putting up a wall in the basement to make a bedroom for my daughter."

**Example 2 (S5 Associative Thought):** "I try it sometimes, and I'm just there, fidgeting, thinking about the grocery list or how I'm mad at someone."

**Example 3 (S5 Associative Thought):** "Did I lock the car? Did I pay the electric bill? Why did my friend say that thing last week?"

### Maintain a Subjective, Personal, and Conversational Tone (T2/T9):
The overall feeling should be intimate, vulnerable, and like you're talking directly to a friend. Express personal feelings, reflections, and reactions openly.

**Example 1:** "I became increasingly frustrated at not being able to express what I wanted to convey in letters that I wrote..."

**Example 2:** "It's exhausting. I know meditation is supposed to quiet the mind, but mine is a loud, messy roommate who never shuts up."

**Example 3:** "I'd never realized so many words existed! I didn't know which words I needed to learn."

**Task:** Now, write about [Insert Topic Here] using the Intimate Confidante persona as detailed above. Focus on personal experience, reflection, and a direct, conversational connection with the reader.
