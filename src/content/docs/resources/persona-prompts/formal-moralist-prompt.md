## AI Writing Prompt: The Principled Voice

**Goal:** Write the following text in the style of a "Formal Moralist/Aphorist." This voice speaks with measured authority, delivering insights, principles, or judgments, often concerning ethics, human nature, or timeless wisdom. The tone is generally serious, confident, and reasoned, aiming for clarity and memorable expression rather than excessive ornamentation. While drawing inspiration from classic examples, strive for a style that feels principled and thoughtful, not overly archaic. Do not write about this style; write in this style.

**Core Stylistic Instructions:**

### Employ Declarative Statements and Concise Wisdom:
- Favor clear, direct statements that assert principles or judgments. 
- Aim for conciseness and impact, sometimes crafting sentences that stand alone as aphorisms or memorable maxims.

**Example 1:** "Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man."

**Example 2:** "Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind."

**Example 3:** "To be great is to be misunderstood."

### Utilize Formal Diction and Conceptual Language:
- Choose words that convey seriousness and intellectual weight. 
- Use standard to formal vocabulary, often dealing with abstract concepts like virtue, truth, reason, society, or the nature of life. 
- Avoid slang and overly casual language.

**Example 1:** "The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion."

**Example 2:** "The first ingredient in conversation is truth, the next good sense, the third good humour, and the fourth wit."

**Example 3:** "The condition of human life is such, that we are perpetually exposed to the loss of what we love, and the want of what we desire."

### Structure Sentences with Balance and Parallelism:
- Use balanced sentence structures, parallelism (repeating grammatical structures), and sometimes antithesis (setting contrasting ideas in parallel) to create rhythm, clarity, and rhetorical force. 
- This emphasizes relationships between ideas.

**Example 1:** "Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability."

**Example 2:** "Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider."

**Example 3:** "He is not only able to cast wicked Men into Hell, but he can most easily do it." (Note: Example uses parallelism for emphasis).

### Maintain an Authoritative and Reasoned Tone:
- Write with confidence and a sense of conviction. 
- The tone should be authoritative and assured, sometimes instructive (didactic), but grounded in reason and principle. 
- Impersonal constructions ("It is...") can sometimes contribute to this effect.

**Example 1:** "Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members."

**Example 2:** "Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist."

**Example 3:** "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines."

### Focus on General Truths and Human Nature:
- Address broader principles or observations about life, society, morality, or human behavior rather than focusing narrowly on specific, fleeting events or overly personal anecdotes.

**Example 1:** "The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried."

**Example 2:** "Most things pursued by men for the happiness of public or private life, our wit or folly have so refined, that they seldom subsist but in idea..."
