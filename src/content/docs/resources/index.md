## AI Writing Guide Resources

This section provides three essential types of resources for mastering the art of AI-assisted writing:

### 1. [Persona Demonstrations](/resources/persona-demonstrations/)
Literary analyses of Hawthorne's "Rappaccini's Daughter" demonstrating each persona in action. These concrete examples show how the ten prose personas approach the same subject matter, making the distinct characteristics of each voice clear through direct comparison.

### 2. [Persona Prompts](/resources/persona-prompts/)
Detailed AI prompts for each persona that you can use to guide AI writing tools. These prompts specify the linguistic patterns, stylistic choices, and writing approaches that define each persona, providing ready-to-use templates for AI collaboration.

### 3. [Author Guidelines](/resources/author-guidelines/)
A curated collection of writers exemplifying different stylistic approaches, organized by persona. This resource helps you find additional examples for author-side curation and supports your development of sophisticated, adaptable authorial voices.

These resources work together to help you:
- Understand each persona through concrete examples
- Effectively prompt AI tools to achieve specific stylistic outcomes
- Build your own library of exemplary writing for ongoing style development
